    <h4>19 PAGES WITHOUT META DESCRIPTIONS </h4>
    <p>Though meta descriptions don't have a direct influence on rankings, they
    are used by search engines to display your page's description in search results. A good
    description helps users know what your page is about and encourages them to click on it. If
    your page's meta description tag is missing, search engines will usually display its first
    sentence, which may be irrelevant and unappealing to users</p>
    <h4>72 PAGES CONTAIN TITTLE AND H1 TAG THAT ARE DUPLICATED</h4>
    <p> It is a bad idea to duplicate your title tag content in your first-level header.
        If your page's <"title"> and <"h1">tags match, the latter may appear over-optimized to search
        engines. Also, using the same content in titles and headers means a lost opportunity to
        incorporate other relevant keywords for your page</p>
    <h4>29 PAGES HAVE DUPLICATE META DESCRIPTION </h4>
    <p> pages that have duplicate meta descriptions only if
        they are exact matches. A <"meta description"> tag is a short summary of a webpage's
        content that helps search engines understand what the page is about and can be shown to
        users in search results. Duplicate meta descriptions on different pages mean a lost
        opportunity to use more relevant keywords.
        Also, duplicate meta descriptions make it difficult for search engines and users to
        differentiate between different webpages. It is better to have no meta description at all than
        to have a duplicate one. How to fix: Provide a unique, relevant meta description for each of
         your webpages.</p>
       <h4>58 PAGES HAVE SINGLE INCOMMING INTERNAL LINK </h4>
       <p> Having very few incoming internal links means very few visits, or even
        none, and fewer chances of placing in search results. It is a good practice to add more
        incoming internal links to pages with useful content. That way, you can rest assured that
        users and search engines will never miss them</p>
